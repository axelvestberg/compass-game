## Draw a prototype of the app:

## Write a description of how the app should work:
1. Connect to a “game”.
2. Game randoms a location.
3. User points phone to where they think location is relative to their position.
4. User confirms ‘done’ (time limit of 30 sec)
5. When all users confirm ‘done’ or time is up.
6. Game announces difference in degrees of users guess and the correct direction.
7. Option is given to guess a new location.
8. If yes - random a location. If no - users are routed to score screen.

## Future versions:
- You can join a public game with people in a specified radius. Since the game calculates direction based on user position they don't need to be on the same location. However, guessing a location versus people who are much nearer or further will create a skewed advantage.

## Questionmarks:
1. How to connect to a game?
- Url?
- List of “games” in the app
- Public games
- Private games with autogenerated passwords

2. How to create game / user?
